What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	My thoughts:

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	I think the staging area functions as an intermediate space between the working directory and the repository. It allows you to bundle various files/changes to those files into a single space and commit all of them together if so merited when committing to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	You can use "git diff" and "git diff --staged" to view any changes you
	have made between two files in the working directory, staged area and in the repository. And then just commit files/changes individually based on one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	Hint: this is how you view a diagram of the branch structure.
	"git log --graph --oneline branch_name1 branch_name2 bran_name_etc"

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
